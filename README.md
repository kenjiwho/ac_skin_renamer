# AC Skin Renamer

A small utility for renaming Assetto Corsa skins.  
You can either download a prebuilt executable or build it yourself.

# To use this app:
download the latest release here https://github.com/kenjiwho/ac_skin_renamer/releases

or build the executable on your own machine
# Building the executable

## Short version

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenjiwho/ac_skin_renamer.git
```
2. go into the main folder and run build script:
```bash
./build.ps1
```
Now you have the executible: ac_renamer.exe, this can be used on it's own.

Note: It will create a folder and a file at it's directory to store data so placing it in a folder before execution is advised.
